# The BuckleScript Cookbook

The BuckleScript Cookbook is a collection of simple examples intended to both showcase BuckleScript by example, and to demonstrate good practices for accomplishing common tasks.

This was heavily inspired by the [Rust Cookbook](https://brson.github.io/rust-cookbook/).

## Contributing

There are primarily two ways to contribute:

1. Suggest an example to include in the cookbook by [creating an issue](https://github.com/glennsl/bucklescript-cookbook/issues/new) to describe the task.
2. Add (or edit) an example by [editing this file directly](https://github.com/glennsl/bucklescript-cookbook/edit/master/README.md) and creating a pull request.
